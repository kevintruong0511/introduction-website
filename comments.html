        <h1 class="label">AESTHETIC SECTION</h1>
        <p>Generally, this website's aesthetic is designed to provide users with a visually appealing and intuitive
            experience. The layout showcases a harmonious blend of colors, typography, and imagery, while also
            maintaining a
            professional and organized appearance. The use of background images, carefully chosen fonts, and smooth
            transitions creates an immersive atmosphere that invites users to explore the website's content. The aim is
            to
            evoke a sense of sophistication, modernity, and approachability, allowing users to perceive my webpages as
            both
            informative and engaging. The aspects of my Webpage's aesthetics are provided below.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-label">a. Structure, Layout & Effect (Interactivity)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The first webpage and last webpage have similar structure, so do the others.</li>
            <li>The navigation bar located at the top of the page and styled with a semi-transparent background,
                containing the site tilte and a list of navigation items with cool hover effect. This section uses
                flexbox layout to aligns the profile picture on the same line and push to the 2 sides of the page.</li>
            <li>Header positioned right below the nav bar contains a circular profile image centered on the page
                followed by a heading and a sub-heading.</li>
            <li>About-Me section is place right below the header, structured inside a white container with the opacity
                of 0.6 creates a slight transparent effect. The container include a title with a styled left border and
                two paragraph of text. This section uses consistent internal padding, rounded corners, and a shadow to
                visually separate it from the background. </li>
            <li>Following that, a grid layout is used to display multiple hobby cards that arranged responsively in rows
                and columns (<span class=code>grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr))</span> -
                ensuring the
                layout adapts to different screen sizes). Each .hobby card include an image (.hobby-img) at the top and
                A title (.hobby-label) and a short description (.hobby-text) below. Cards are evenly spaced using gap,
                and each card has padding, border-radius, and subtle hover effects.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="double-image-container">
            <img src="images/hobbies.png" class="double-image-member" alt="Hobbies grid image">
            <img src="images/grid.png" class="double-image-member" alt="Hobbies grid image with responsive design">
        </div>
        <h3 class="sub-label">b. Graphical Features</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The color palette of the website is primarily composed of soft purple, lavender, and light blue tones,
                creating a calm and modern aesthetic. These colors are used consistently across the background
                gradients, section containers, and text highlights to maintain visual harmony and identity. The gradient
                transitions between blue and violet establish a clean, futuristic impression</li>
            <li>The text colors are chosen for clear readability, with dark gray (#1e1e2e) used for body text to ensure
                sufficient contrast against the light background, while headings adopt a more vibrant purple (#5d13d4)
                to emphasize hierarchy and draw attention to key sections.</li>
            <li>The background design utilizes linear gradients to create smooth color transitions and depth throughout
                the page. The combination of a gradient header background and semi-transparent containers (rgba(236,
                233, 240, 0.6)) helps separate sections without hard edges, giving the page a polished and layered look.
            </li>
            <li>The navigation bar incorporates a frosted-glass effect using a semi-transparent background (rgba(255,
                255, 255, 0.4)) and a blur filter (backdrop-filter: blur(10px)). This modern design technique maintains
                visibility of the navigation links while allowing background colors to subtly show through.</li>
            <li>The use of consistent color tones, soft shadows, and rounded borders across all elements creates a
                cohesive visual style that reflects simplicity, professionalism, and a focus on clarity — aligning the
                graphical presentation with the website’s purpose of showcasing personal and academic information.</li>

        </ol>
        <h3 class="sub-label">c. Typyography</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The primary font used throughout the website is a serif typeface, providing a formal and academic
                appearance. This choice contributes to a clean and professional visual presentation that suits the
                informative and portfolio-style nature of the website.</li>
            <li>The font sizes are defined using responsive viewport units (vw), ensuring that text elements such as
                headings and paragraphs automatically scale according to the screen size. This enhances readability
                across both desktop and mobile devices.</li>
            <li>Headings (h1, h2, and labels) use larger font sizes and distinct colors such as purple (#5d13d4)
                to create visual hierarchy and emphasize section titles, while paragraph text maintains a smaller,
                consistent size for smooth reading.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="sub-label">d. White Spacing</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Consistent margins, padding, and line heights are used to ensure a balanced and readable layout,
                especially within text blocks and container elements.</li>
            <li>White space is applied throughout the website to separate major sections such as the header, “About Me,”
                and “Hobbies and Interests,” allowing each area to stand out clearly without feeling crowded.The use of
                grid and flex layouts provides even spacing between images, cards, and navigation elements, improving
                visual flow and maintaining a clean, organized structure across the page.</li>
            <li>The use of grid and flex layouts provides even spacing between images, cards, and navigation elements,
                improving visual flow and maintaining a clean, organized structure across the page.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1 class="label">ACCESSIBILITY SECTION</h1>
        <h3 class="sub-label">Responsive Design</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The website is designed to be fully responsive, adjusting its layout, text size, and image proportions
                across
                different screen sizes. Viewport units (vw, vh) are used to ensure consistent scaling of headings and
                content. The navigation bar and header remain aligned using flexbox, while the grid layout in the
                “Hobbies
                and Interests” section automatically reorganizes into one or multiple columns depending on the device.
                This
                responsive structure improves accessibility, ensuring the website remains clear, readable, and
                user-friendly
                on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="double-image-container">
            <img src="images/hobbies.png" class="double-image-member" alt="hobbies grid layout">
            <img src="images/grid.png" class="double-image-member" alt="hobbies grid layout with responsive design">
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-label">Alt Altributes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The second factor is the use of alt attributes on images. Alt attributes provide a description of the
                image content for screen readers, which is important for users who are visually impaired and rely on
                these tools to understand the content of the website.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="sub-label">Contrast</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The third factor is the contrast between the background color and text color. Good contrast is important
                for readability, particularly for users with visual impairments.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="double-image-container">
